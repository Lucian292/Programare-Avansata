Classes and Interfaces

A social network contains persons and companies, each of them identifiable by unique names.
In this network there are relationships of the following types: person-to-person (if they know each other, how?), and person-to-company (if the person works for that company, on what position?).
There may be various types of "specialized" persons in the network, such as programmers or designers.

The main specifications of the application are:

si la final lista tuturor angajatilor fiecarei companii.
